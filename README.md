# Audio Transcription Summarizer 

Using OpenAI's Whisper-1 and GPT-3 this Python script allows user to upload audio (mp3, wav, m4a) files and obtain summarized notes of the recording.

## Development Setup:

- Run `pip install openai` in the main folder
- Run `python main.py` to start the program


## Test Notes:

- Carbon-carbon single bonds, double bonds, and triple bonds are known as alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes, respectively
- Alkanes and single bonds between carbons do not count as functional groups, as they serve as the carbon backbone
- A six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds is called a benzene ring
- Directly attached benzene rings are called phenyl, one carbon away is called benzyl
- Adding heteroatoms with a single bond to carbons creates different functional groups
- Heteroatoms like halogens, nitrogen-containing groups, and hydroxyl groups result in alkyl halides, amines, and alcohols, respectively
- Replacing the O in an alcohol with an R group creates an ether, and with an S creates a thiol
- A C triple bond N becomes a nitrile as a functional group
- Carbonyls (C double bond O) are not functional groups but can become functional groups depending on what they are attached to
- If attached to carbon chain, carbonyls are called aldehydes or ketones, depending on location
- Combining carbonyls with heteroatoms creates new functional groups, such as
