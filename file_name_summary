- Alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes are single, double, and triple bonds between carbon atoms respectively
- Alkanes do not count as functional groups because they are the backbone of the molecule
- A benzene ring is a six-membered ring with alternating single and double bonds
- The name of the functional group depends on if the ring is directly attached to the main chain (phenyl) or one carbon away (benzyl)
- Heteroatoms attached to carbon with a single bond have different functional group names
- Halogens attached to carbon are called alkyl halides, nitrogen-containing groups are amines, and OH groups are alcohols
- Replacing O with S creates a thiol and a C triple bond N creates a nitrile functional group
- Carbonyls (C double bond O) are not functional groups on their own but can be combined with heteroatoms to change the functional group name
- Carbonyl with alkyl halide becomes an acid halide, carbonyl with amine becomes an amide, carbonyl with alcohol becomes a carboxylic acid, and carbonyl with ether becomes an ester.
