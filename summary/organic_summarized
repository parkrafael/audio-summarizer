- Carbon-carbon single bonds, double bonds, and triple bonds are known as alkanes, alkenes, and alkynes respectively.
- An alkane or a single bond between carbons is not considered a functional group as it serves as the carbon backbone to the entire molecule.
- A six-membered ring with alternating single bonds and double bonds is called a benzene ring.
- If the benzene ring is attached directly to the main chain, it's called a phenyl. If it's one carbon away, it's called a benzyl.
- Functional groups can be created by adding heteroatoms with a single bond to carbons. The name of the functional group depends on the type of heteroatom used.
- If a halogen is attached with a single bond to carbons, it's called an alkyl halide.
- If a nitrogen-containing group is attached to carbon with a single bond, it's called an amine.
- If an OH group is attached to a carbon single bond, it's called an alcohol.
- If an R group is attached to the O instead of an H in an alcohol, it becomes an ether.
- If the O in an alcohol is replaced with an S, it becomes a thiol.
- If a C triple bond N is used as a functional group, it's called a nitrile.
- Carbonyls (C double bond Os) are not technically functional groups but can become functional groups depending on what they're next to.
- A carbonyl attached to the carbon chain is called an aldehyde or a ketone depending on its position in the chain.
- Combining a carbonyl with a heteroatom alters the functional group and gives it a new name: an alkyl halide becomes an acid halide, an amine becomes an amide, an alcohol becomes a carboxylic acid, and an ether becomes an ester.
